Have you ever wanted more time in the day? Well, that just isn't possible (yet). Instead, try using the Hourly Work Scheduler, which allows you to plan out your entire work day, hour by hour. Starting at 5am for those early-risers among us, you can see, add, and edit your hourly schedule. Be amazed by the dynamic updating of the time and hour, and by the clever use of color to let you know when yes, the hour is gone. We'll all be a little older but, hopefully, a little more productive!

**Front Page** When you first load the page, it displays hours past as grey, hours future as green, and the hour at hand (present) in pink. The date and time are displayed at the top of the page and refreshed automatically.

**Enter a task** When you want to enter a task, simply click on the empty space besides the hour you want to complete it in. You can enter whatever you'd like, and to save the task, simply click out of the text area. When you refresh your page, all tasks are saved, and will persist! That is, until the next day...a new day brings new tasks, after all.

**Example tasks** Here you can see the hour is 6pm (or 18, for those superior beings using the 24 hour clock). All hours before 6pm are greyed out, in the past, gone but not forgotten. All hours still left in the work day (7pm alone, in this case) are green to represent their limitless possibility. Now, you try it! Happy scheduling.
